**Describe the content or mechanics you are proposing.**
Firstly, to have dedicated spawn points for each unit type.
Secondly, to be able to make waypoints for units to follow and possibly fix pathing issues.

**Describe how you think this content will improve the game. If you're proposing new content, mention how it may add more gameplay options or how it will fill a new niche.**

1.  Dedicated spawn points.
In my case, I have created a survival map which only has 1 1x1 red spawn point area.  I've purposefully done this to keep control of unit / wave scaling.  However, both naval and ground mechs have to spawn at the same place, which means having water underlying the spawn point.  An increased number of naval units eventually start pushing ground units into deep water and they perish.

By being able to set a dedicated naval unit spawn point, user can make sure all naval units spawn on water and won't have the tendency to push ground units into deep water and their deaths.  Ground units can have their own dedicated spawn point which avoids naval being spawned on land.

The opportunities this could lead to in having dedicated "attack fronts" - having different unit types pose different threats from different points on the map.

The red 'S' logo used in the editor for spawn points could be changed to [red]S[green]A [black]for air unit spawn, [red]S[yellow]G [black]for ground unit spawn, and [red]S[blue]N [black]for naval unit spawn.

2.  Waypoints

in some case, where there is a maze for enemy naval units to follow to get to the nearest enemy core to destroy it, the naval pathing can lead to being stuck against a wall, even though there is an indirect (longer) path for the naval units to reach the player teams core.

having the option to set way points for enemy units to follow can initially help units know which area they must travel to first as a priority, before they return to 'general' pathing.

as an example, on my map https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2240728575 (which was purposefully created as a sandbox / survival map to show off your beta developments), the ground mechs and the naval mechs have a windy path to take to get to the players cores.  The ground mechs navigate this easily, but the naval mechs get stuck against a wall and refuse to travel the length of the river.

Being able to set waypoints in the editor may alleviate such pathing issues.

it could benefit the player team getting around this issue also through having to place multiple command centres or using logic to overcome pathing issues.

thank you for your consideration.  Proud to support your game on Steam.
